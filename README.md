## About Me

I'm a Front End DeV & AI Enthusiast.

With a Master‚Äôs degree in Physics, specializing in the physics of materials, and currently pursuing software engineering at [1337](https://1337.ma), I am immersed in a dynamic and rigorous curriculum that emphasizes practical learning, problem-solving.
I also blend strong analytical thinking with engineering principles to lead projects and solve complex problems.
I‚Äôm always excited to connect with like-minded professionals to share knowledge and explore new opportunities in software engineering and beyond.

Since November 2023, I have tackled a wide array of projects, honing my skills in various domains.
Driven by discipline, a continuous learning mindset, and a passion for problem-solving, I am eager to take on new challenges and further expand my skill set.
Collaboration and communication are at the core of my work, and I thrive in team environments where I can contribute and grow alongside others.
